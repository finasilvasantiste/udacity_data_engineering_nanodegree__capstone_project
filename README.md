TBD

## Datasets
- [Tokyo Airbnb Open Data: Tokyo Airbnb as of 28 October 2021](https://www.kaggle.com/tsarromanov/tokyo-airbnb-open-data)
- [COVID-19 dataset in Japan - Number of Novel Corona Virus 2019 cases in Japan](https://www.kaggle.com/lisphilar/covid19-dataset-in-japan)

## Scenario
Business Analysts at Airbnb want to understand the impact COVID-19 had on bookings and listings 
during the timespan of 2020-2021 in Tokyo, Japan. 

### Questions to answer
1. Trends to find out:
   - Active vs inactive listings
   - Bookings
   - Positive COVID-19 cases
2. Correlate trends to each other:
   - Is there a negative correlation between positive COVID-19 cases and bookings or active listings?
   - Does a listings shortage or oversupply exist? If yes, how does it relate to positive COVID-19 cases?
